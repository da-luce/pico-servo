# ⚙️ Pico Servo Driver

A small, efficient, and robust library designed for controlling servos on the RP[2040](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2040/rp2040-datasheet.pdf)/[2350](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2350/rp2350-datasheet.pdf). It comes with useful features like easing and more, allowing you to easily integrate precise servo control into your projects.

This project was tested on [MG90S](https://towerpro.com.tw/product/mg90s-3/) servos and a [Pico 2 W](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/picow/pico-2-w-datasheet.pdf). It should work on all other Pico variants, and most servos. To use the library, simply add `servo.c` and `servo.h` to your project.

## Examples

You may try examples by updating the `EXAMPLE_NAME` variable in [CMakeLists.txt](./CMakeLists.txt) to point to the desired source file, e.g.

```c
set(EXAMPLE_NAME examples/basic)
```

### Wiring

Here's a simple wiring diagram showing an MG90S servo connected to a Pico using [Wowki](https://wokwi.com/pi-pico). Power is sourced from [VBUS](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/Pico-R3-A4-Pinout.pdf) (5V when the Pico is powered via micro-USB), which is typically safe for small servos like the MG90S. However, larger or high-torque servos may exceed the current the Pico can supply, so an external power source is recommended in those cases.

### Basic

The [basic example](./examples/basic.c) showing how to configure and control a servo using the Servo struct:

```c
#include "servo.h"

Servo servo = {
    .gpio               = 22u,
    .period_usec        = 20000u,
    .duty_min_usec      = 500u,
    .duty_max_usec      = 2500u,
};

int main()
{
    servo_init(&servo);
    servo_set_deg(&servo, 90.0f);
}
```

### Easing

A key feature of this library is its support for smooth, eased servo motions using interpolation functions (see [easing](./examples/easing.c) and [non_blocking](./examples/non_blocking.c) demos):

```c
// Same setup as above...

#define SEC 1000000u // One second in microseconds

int main()
{
    servo_init(&servo);

    servo_set_deg_ease_wait(&servo, 180.0f, 2 * SEC, ease_in_expo);
    servo_set_deg_ease_wait(&servo, 0.0f, SEC, ease_inverse_smoothstep);
    servo_set_deg_ease_wait(&servo, 180.0f, SEC, ease_inverse_smoothstep);
    servo_set_deg_ease_wait(&servo, 0.0f, 2 * SEC, ease_out_expo);
}
```

### Multiple Servos

As mentioned above, all functions wait until the specified servo is available before starting a new movement. This means you can issue commands to different servos concurrently, and they will begin moving in parallel:

```c
servo_time_to_deg(&servoA, 180.0f, SEC, ease_lin);
servo_time_to_deg(&servoB, 180.0f, SEC, ease_lin);

servo_time_to_deg(&servoA, 0.0f, SEC, ease_lin);
servo_time_to_deg(&servoB, 0.0f, SEC, ease_lin);
```

However, if you issue multiple commands to the same servo, each command will block until the previous one has started, resulting in sequential execution:

```c
servo_time_to_deg(&servoA, 180.0f, SEC, ease_lin);
servo_time_to_deg(&servoA, 0.0f, SEC, ease_lin);

servo_time_to_deg(&servoB, 180.0f, SEC, ease_lin);
servo_time_to_deg(&servoB, 0.0f, SEC, ease_lin);
```

Given this, to cooordinate movements more cleanly, it's often a good idea to control each servo from a dedicated thread or [protothread](https://dunkels.com/adam/pt/), like in the [multithreading example](./examples/threading/multi_threading.c).

## API

To initialize a servo structure, call `servo_init`. Use `servo_deinit` to disable and reset the servo when it's no longer needed. **Failing to call `servo_init` will result in strange behavior.**

> [!NOTE]
> Each servo must use a GPIO mapped to a unique [PWM slice](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2350/rp2350-datasheet.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A1077%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C115%2C165.63628%2Cnull%5D).
> While the Pico exposes 24 PWM channels, only 12 independent slices are available—thus this library supports up to 12 servos.

All functions wait until the servo is available before initiating a new movement.
However, once the movement begins, the function returns immediately.
If you want the function to block until the movement is fully completed,
use the corresponding `_wait` variant.

> [!WARNING]
> For position control functions, the wait time is estimated using the specified servo speed when [position feedback](https://learn.adafruit.com/analog-feedback-servos/about-servos-and-feedback) is not available. However, a servo's actual speed depends not only on its rated specifications but also on factors like the angle delta and motor load. As a result, the wait functions provide only an approximate blocking time in the absence of position feedback.

| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Position         | `servo_set_deg`<br>`servo_set_rad`           | Move the servo directly to the specified angle.                                              |                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Time             | `servo_time_to_deg`<br>`servo_time_to_rad`   | Move the servo to the specified angle over a set duration, with a specified easing function. | This is implemented with interrupts, and thus runs in the background. The non-wait variants may be canceled. Upon completion, these functions support a callback.       |
| Speed            | `servo_speed_to_deg`<br>`servo_speed_to_rad` | Move the servo to the specified angle at a defined speed.                                    | This is simply a nice wrapper which uses the Time functions under the hood. The non-wait variants may be canceled. Upon completion, these functions support a callback. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're using PWM IRQs for other purposes, register your IRQ handler as shared. You can do this either before or after initializing all servos. In your handler, ensure that you only handle interrupts for the slices you are controlling. For an example, refer to [other_irq.c](./examples/other_irq.c).

> [!CAUTION]
> Commanding large, fast movements while the servo is under load can also cause wear or breakage. Use easing and/or the `_wait` function variants for safer transitions.

### Easing Functions

The following easing functions are provided for the timed commands (feel free to make your own too!)
These functions map a progress value `x` from `[0.0, 1.0]` to an eased output in `[0.0, 1.0]`.

| **Category** | **Function Name(s)**                      | **Description**                                                    |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Linear       | `ease_lin`                                | Constant-speed transition.                                         |
| Sine         | `ease_sin`                                | Smooth sinusoidal acceleration and deceleration.                   |
| Ease In      | `ease_in_quad`, `ease_in_expo`            | Starts slow, then accelerates.                                     |
| Ease Out     | `ease_out_quad`, `ease_out_expo`          | Starts fast, then decelerates.                                     |
| Ease In-Out  | *(combine an In + Out function manually)* | Smooth start and end—custom blend.                                 |
| Bounce       | `ease_in_bounce`, `ease_out_bounce`       | Simulates elastic bounce-in or bounce-out--more fun than practical. |

# ⚙️ Pico Servo Driver

A small, efficient, and robust library designed for controlling servos on the RP2040/2350. It comes with useful features like easing and more, allowing you to easily integrate precise servo control into your projects.

This project was tested on [MG90S](https://towerpro.com.tw/product/mg90s-3/) servos and a [Pico 2 W](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/picow/pico-2-w-datasheet.pdf). It should work on all other Pico variants, and most servos.

To use the library, simply add `servo.c` and `servo.h` to your project.

## Examples

### Basic

Here's a [minimal example](./examples/basic.c) showing how to configure and control a servo using the Servo struct:

```c
#include "servo.h"

Servo servo = {
    .gpio               = 22,
    .period_usec        = 20000u,
    .duty_min_usec      = 500u,
    .duty_max_usec      = 2500u,
};

int main()
{
    servo_init(&servo);
    servo_set_deg(&servo, 90.0f);
}
```

### Easing

A key feature of this library is its support for smooth, eased servo motions using interpolation functions (see [easing](./examples/easing.c) and [non_blocking](./examples/non_blocking.c) demos):

```c
// Same setup as above...

#define SEC 1000000u // One second in microseconds

int main()
{
    servo_init(&servo);

    servo_set_deg_ease_wait(&servo, 180.0f, 2 * SEC, ease_in_expo);
    servo_set_deg_ease_wait(&servo, 0.0f, SEC, ease_inverse_smoothstep);
    servo_set_deg_ease_wait(&servo, 180.0f, SEC, ease_inverse_smoothstep);
    servo_set_deg_ease_wait(&servo, 0.0f, 2 * SEC, ease_out_expo);
}
```

## Multiple Servos

As mentioned above, all functions wait until the specified servo is available before starting a new movement. This means you can issue commands to different servos concurrently, and they will begin moving in parallel:

```c
servo_time_to_deg(&servoA, 180.0f, SEC, ease_lin);
servo_time_to_deg(&servoB, 180.0f, SEC, ease_lin);

servo_time_to_deg(&servoA, 0.0f, SEC, ease_lin);
servo_time_to_deg(&servoB, 0.0f, SEC, ease_lin);
```

However, if you issue multiple commands to the same servo, each command will block until the previous one has started, resulting in sequential execution:

```c
servo_time_to_deg(&servoA, 180.0f, SEC, ease_lin);
servo_time_to_deg(&servoA, 0.0f, SEC, ease_lin);

servo_time_to_deg(&servoB, 180.0f, SEC, ease_lin);
servo_time_to_deg(&servoB, 0.0f, SEC, ease_lin);
```

Given this, to coordinate movements more cleanly, it's often a good idea to control each servo from a dedicated thread or protothread, like in the [multithreading example](./examples/threading/multi_threading.c).

## TODO

- [ ] Iron out edge case bugs (see FIXMEs)
- [ ] Add ability to interrupt ease functions
- [ ] Add functions for servos with position feedback
- [ ] Test other servos
- [ ] Test multiple servos at the same time

## API

All functions wait until the servo is available before initiating a new movement.
However, once the movement begins, the function returns immediately.
If you want the function to block until the movement is fully completed,
use the corresponding `_wait` variant.

| **Control Type** | **Functions**                                | **Description**                                                                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Position         | `servo_set_deg`<br>`servo_set_rad`           | Move the servo directly to the specified angle.                                              |
| Time             | `servo_time_to_deg`<br>`servo_time_to_rad`   | Move the servo to the specified angle over a set duration, with a specified easing function. |
| Speed            | `servo_speed_to_deg`<br>`servo_speed_to_rad` | Move the servo to the specified angle at a defined speed.                                    |

The following easing functions are provided for the timed commands

| **Type**      | **Function Name** | **Description**                                       |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `Linear`      | `ease_lin`    | Constant-speed transition.                            |
| `Ease In`     |               | Starts slow, speeds up (e.g. quadratic, exponential). |
| `Ease Out`    |               | Starts fast, slows to target.                         |
| `Ease In-Out` |               | Combines both for smooth transitions.                 |
| `Sine`        |               | Smooth, sinusoidal motion.                            |
| `Bounce`      |               | Simulates bounce-back at the end of motion.           |

## Waiting Functions

Warning: the speed of a servo is dependent not only it's formal specification, but the requested angle delta and torque on the motor. Thus, the waiting functions provide a general estimate on blocking time, but not exact, unless feedback is provided.

## Important Notes

- Each servo must use a GPIO mapped to a unique [PWM slice](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2350/rp2350-datasheet.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A1077%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C115%2C165.63628%2Cnull%5D)
- Servos must be configured to use GPIOs on separate
- While the Pico exposes 24 PWM channels, only 12 independent slices are available—this library supports up to 12 servos.
- It's your responsibility to ensure that servos are not commanded beyond their mechanical speed or range limits
- If you are using PWM IRQs for other purposes, register your IRQ handler after
  initializing all servos and call `servo_on_pwm_wrap()` at the top of your handler (this is untested)
